### Validation Architecture (Nyquist Layer)

During plan-phase research, GSD now maps automated test coverage to each phase
requirement before any code is written. This ensures that when Claude's executor
commits a task, a feedback mechanism already exists to verify it within seconds.

The researcher detects your existing test infrastructure, maps each requirement to
a specific test command, and identifies any test scaffolding that must be created
before implementation begins (Wave 0 tasks).

The plan-checker enforces this as an 8th verification dimension: plans where tasks
lack automated verify commands will not be approved.

**Output:** `{phase}-VALIDATION.md` -- the feedback contract for the phase.

**Disable:** Set `workflow.nyquist_validation: false` in `/gsdt:settings` for
rapid prototyping phases where test infrastructure isn't the focus.

### Retroactive Validation (`/gsdt:validate-phase`)

For phases executed before Nyquist validation existed, or for existing codebases
with only traditional test suites, retroactively audit and fill coverage gaps:

```
  /gsdt:validate-phase N
         |
         +-- Detect state (VALIDATION.md exists? SUMMARY.md exists?)
         |
         +-- Discover: scan implementation, map requirements to tests
         |
         +-- Analyze gaps: which requirements lack automated verification?
         |
         +-- Present gap plan for approval
         |
         +-- Spawn auditor: generate tests, run, debug (max 3 attempts)
         |
         +-- Update VALIDATION.md
               |
               +-- COMPLIANT -> all requirements have automated checks
               +-- PARTIAL -> some gaps escalated to manual-only
```

The auditor never modifies implementation code — only test files and
VALIDATION.md. If a test reveals an implementation bug, it's flagged as an
escalation for you to address.

**When to use:** After executing phases that were planned before Nyquist was
enabled, or after `/gsdt:audit-milestone` surfaces Nyquist compliance gaps.

### Assumptions Discussion Mode

By default, `/gsdt:discuss-phase` asks open-ended questions about your implementation preferences. Assumptions mode inverts this: GSD reads your codebase first, surfaces structured assumptions about how it would build the phase, and asks only for corrections.

**Enable:** Set `workflow.discuss_mode` to `'assumptions'` via `/gsdt:settings`.

**How it works:**
1. Reads PROJECT.md, codebase mapping, and existing conventions
2. Generates a structured list of assumptions (tech choices, patterns, file locations)
3. Presents assumptions for you to confirm, correct, or expand
4. Writes CONTEXT.md from confirmed assumptions

**When to use:**
- Experienced developers who already know their codebase well
- Rapid iteration where open-ended questions slow you down
- Projects where patterns are well-established and predictable

See [docs/workflow-discuss-mode.md](workflow-discuss-mode.md) for the full discuss-mode reference.

## UI Design Contract

### Why

AI-generated frontends are visually inconsistent not because Claude Code is bad at UI but because no design contract existed before execution. Five components built without a shared spacing scale, color contract, or copywriting standard produce five slightly different visual decisions.

`/gsdt:ui-phase` locks the design contract before planning. `/gsdt:ui-review` audits the result after execution.

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/gsdt:ui-phase [N]` | Generate UI-SPEC.md design contract for a frontend phase |
| `/gsdt:ui-review [N]` | Retroactive 6-pillar visual audit of implemented UI |

### Workflow: `/gsdt:ui-phase`

**When to run:** After `/gsdt:discuss-phase`, before `/gsdt:plan-phase` — for phases with frontend/UI work.

**Flow:**
1. Reads CONTEXT.md, RESEARCH.md, REQUIREMENTS.md for existing decisions
2. Detects design system state (shadcn components.json, Tailwind config, existing tokens)
3. shadcn initialization gate — offers to initialize if React/Next.js/Vite project has none
4. Asks only unanswered design contract questions (spacing, typography, color, copywriting, registry safety)
5. Writes `{phase}-UI-SPEC.md` to phase directory
6. Validates against 6 dimensions (Copywriting, Visuals, Color, Typography, Spacing, Registry Safety)
7. Revision loop if BLOCKED (max 2 iterations)

**Output:** `{padded_phase}-UI-SPEC.md` in `.claude/.gsdt-planning/phases/{phase-dir}/`

### Workflow: `/gsdt:ui-review`

**When to run:** After `/gsdt:execute-phase` or `/gsdt:verify-work` — for any project with frontend code.

**Standalone:** Works on any project, not just GSD-managed ones. If no UI-SPEC.md exists, audits against abstract 6-pillar standards.

**6 Pillars (scored 1-4 each):**
1. Copywriting — CTA labels, empty states, error states
2. Visuals — focal points, visual hierarchy, icon accessibility
3. Color — accent usage discipline, 60/30/10 compliance
4. Typography — font size/weight constraint adherence
5. Spacing — grid alignment, token consistency
6. Experience Design — loading/error/empty state coverage

**Output:** `{padded_phase}-UI-REVIEW.md` in phase directory with scores and top 3 priority fixes.

### Configuration

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `workflow.ui_phase` | `true` | Generate UI design contracts for frontend phases |
| `workflow.ui_safety_gate` | `true` | plan-phase prompts to run /gsdt:ui-phase for frontend phases |

Both follow the absent=enabled pattern. Disable via `/gsdt:settings`.

### shadcn Initialization

For React/Next.js/Vite projects, the UI researcher offers to initialize shadcn if no `components.json` is found. The flow:

1. Visit `ui.shadcn.com/create` and configure your preset
2. Copy the preset string
3. Run `npx shadcn init --preset {paste}`
4. Preset encodes the entire design system — colors, border radius, fonts

The preset string becomes a first-class GSD planning artifact, reproducible across phases and milestones.

### Registry Safety Gate

Third-party shadcn registries can inject arbitrary code. The safety gate requires:
- `npx shadcn view {component}` — inspect before installing
- `npx shadcn diff {component}` — compare against official

Controlled by `workflow.ui_safety_gate` config toggle.

### Screenshot Storage

`/gsdt:ui-review` captures screenshots via Playwright CLI to `.claude/.gsdt-planning/ui-reviews/`. A `.gitignore` is created automatically to prevent binary files from reaching git. Screenshots are cleaned up during `/gsdt:complete-milestone`.

---

## Backlog & Threads

### Backlog Parking Lot

Ideas that aren't ready for active planning go into the backlog using 999.x numbering, keeping them outside the active phase sequence.

```
/gsdt:add-backlog "GraphQL API layer"     # Creates 999.1-graphql-api-layer/
/gsdt:add-backlog "Mobile responsive"     # Creates 999.2-mobile-responsive/
```

Backlog items get full phase directories, so you can use `/gsdt:discuss-phase 999.1` to explore an idea further or `/gsdt:plan-phase 999.1` when it's ready.

**Review and promote** with `/gsdt:review-backlog` — it shows all backlog items and lets you promote (move to active sequence), keep (leave in backlog), or remove (delete).

### Seeds

Seeds are forward-looking ideas with trigger conditions. Unlike backlog items, seeds surface automatically when the right milestone arrives.

```
/gsdt:plant-seed "Add real-time collab when WebSocket infra is in place"
```

Seeds preserve the full WHY and WHEN to surface. `/gsdt:new-milestone` scans all seeds and presents matches.

**Storage:** `.claude/.gsdt-planning/seeds/SEED-NNN-slug.md`

### Persistent Context Threads

Threads are lightweight cross-session knowledge stores for work that spans multiple sessions but doesn't belong to any specific phase.

```
/gsdt:thread                              # List all threads
/gsdt:thread fix-deploy-key-auth          # Resume existing thread
/gsdt:thread "Investigate TCP timeout"    # Create new thread
```

Threads are lighter weight than `/gsdt:pause-work` — no phase state, no plan context. Each thread file includes Goal, Context, References, and Next Steps sections.

Threads can be promoted to phases (`/gsdt:add-phase`) or backlog items (`/gsdt:add-backlog`) when they mature.

**Storage:** `.claude/.gsdt-planning/threads/{slug}.md`

---

## Workstreams

Workstreams let you work on multiple milestone areas concurrently without state collisions. Each workstream gets its own isolated `.claude/.gsdt-planning/` state, so switching between them doesn't clobber progress.

**When to use:** You're working on milestone features that span different concern areas (e.g., backend API and frontend dashboard) and want to plan, execute, or discuss them independently without context bleed.

### Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/gsdt:workstreams create <name>` | Create a new workstream with isolated planning state |
| `/gsdt:workstreams switch <name>` | Switch active context to a different workstream |
| `/gsdt:workstreams list` | Show all workstreams and which is active |
| `/gsdt:workstreams complete <name>` | Mark a workstream as done and archive its state |

### How It Works

Each workstream maintains its own `.claude/.gsdt-planning/` directory subtree. When you switch workstreams, GSD swaps the active planning context so that `/gsdt:progress`, `/gsdt:discuss-phase`, `/gsdt:plan-phase`, and other commands operate on that workstream's state.

This is lighter weight than `/gsdt:new-workspace` (which creates separate repo worktrees). Workstreams share the same codebase and git history but isolate planning artifacts.

## Security

### Defense-in-Depth (v1.27)

GSD generates markdown files that become LLM system prompts. This means any user-controlled text flowing into planning artifacts is a potential indirect prompt injection vector. v1.27 introduced centralized security hardening:

**Path Traversal Prevention:**
All user-supplied file paths (`--text-file`, `--prd`) are validated to resolve within the project directory. macOS `/var` → `/private/var` symlink resolution is handled.

**Prompt Injection Detection:**
The `security.cjs` module scans for known injection patterns (role overrides, instruction bypasses, system tag injections) in user-supplied text before it enters planning artifacts.

**Runtime Hooks:**
- `gsdt-prompt-guard.js` — Scans Write/Edit calls to `.claude/.gsdt-planning/` for injection patterns (always active, advisory-only)
- `gsdt-workflow-guard.js` — Warns on file edits outside GSD workflow context (opt-in via `hooks.workflow_guard`)

**CI Scanner:**
`prompt-injection-scan.test.cjs` scans all agent, workflow, and command files for embedded injection vectors. Run as part of the test suite.

  }
}
```

### Core Settings

| Setting | Options | Default | What it Controls |
|---------|---------|---------|------------------|
| `mode` | `interactive`, `yolo` | `interactive` | `yolo` auto-approves decisions; `interactive` confirms at each step |
| `granularity` | `coarse`, `standard`, `fine` | `standard` | Phase granularity: how finely scope is sliced (3-5, 5-8, or 8-12 phases) |
| `model_profile` | `quality`, `balanced`, `budget`, `inherit` | `balanced` | Model tier for each agent (see table below) |

### Planning Settings

| Setting | Options | Default | What it Controls |
|---------|---------|---------|------------------|
| `planning.commit_docs` | `true`, `false` | `true` | Whether `.claude/.gsdt-planning/` files are committed to git |
| `planning.search_gitignored` | `true`, `false` | `false` | Add `--no-ignore` to broad searches to include `.claude/.gsdt-planning/` |

> **Note:** If `.claude/.gsdt-planning/` is in `.gitignore`, `commit_docs` is automatically `false` regardless of the config value.

### Workflow Toggles

| Setting | Options | Default | What it Controls |
|---------|---------|---------|------------------|
| `workflow.research` | `true`, `false` | `true` | Domain investigation before planning |
| `workflow.plan_check` | `true`, `false` | `true` | Plan verification loop (up to 3 iterations) |
| `workflow.verifier` | `true`, `false` | `true` | Post-execution verification against phase goals |
| `workflow.nyquist_validation` | `true`, `false` | `true` | Validation architecture research during plan-phase; 8th plan-check dimension |
| `workflow.ui_phase` | `true`, `false` | `true` | Generate UI design contracts for frontend phases |
| `workflow.ui_safety_gate` | `true`, `false` | `true` | plan-phase prompts to run /gsdt:ui-phase for frontend phases |
| `workflow.research_before_questions` | `true`, `false` | `false` | Run research before discussion questions instead of after |
| `workflow.discuss_mode` | `standard`, `assumptions` | `standard` | Discussion style: open-ended questions vs. codebase-driven assumptions |
| `workflow.skip_discuss` | `true`, `false` | `false` | Skip discuss-phase entirely in autonomous mode; writes minimal CONTEXT.md from ROADMAP phase goal |

### Hook Settings

| Setting | Options | Default | What it Controls |
|---------|---------|---------|------------------|
| `hooks.context_warnings` | `true`, `false` | `true` | Context window usage warnings |
| `hooks.workflow_guard` | `true`, `false` | `false` | Warn on file edits outside GSD workflow context |

Disable workflow toggles to speed up phases in familiar domains or when conserving tokens.

### Git Branching

| Setting | Options | Default | What it Controls |
|---------|---------|---------|------------------|
| `git.branching_strategy` | `none`, `phase`, `milestone` | `none` | When and how branches are created |
| `git.phase_branch_template` | Template string | `gsd/phase-{phase}-{slug}` | Branch name for phase strategy |
| `git.milestone_branch_template` | Template string | `gsd/{milestone}-{slug}` | Branch name for milestone strategy |
| `git.quick_branch_template` | Template string or `null` | `null` | Optional branch name for `/gsdt:quick` tasks |

**Branching strategies explained:**

| Strategy | Creates Branch | Scope | Best For |
|----------|---------------|-------|----------|
| `none` | Never | N/A | Solo development, simple projects |
| `phase` | At each `execute-phase` | One phase per branch | Code review per phase, granular rollback |
| `milestone` | At first `execute-phase` | All phases share one branch | Release branches, PR per version |

**Template variables:** `{phase}` = zero-padded number (e.g., "03"), `{slug}` = lowercase hyphenated name, `{milestone}` = version (e.g., "v1.0"), `{num}` / `{quick}` = quick task ID (e.g., "260317-abc").

Example quick-task branching:

```json
"git": {
  "quick_branch_template": "gsd/quick-{num}-{slug}"
}
```

### Model Profiles (Per-Agent Breakdown)

| Agent | `quality` | `balanced` | `budget` | `inherit` |
|-------|-----------|------------|----------|-----------|
| gsdt-planner | Opus | Opus | Sonnet | Inherit |
| gsdt-roadmapper | Opus | Sonnet | Sonnet | Inherit |
| gsdt-executor | Opus | Sonnet | Sonnet | Inherit |
| gsdt-phase-researcher | Opus | Sonnet | Haiku | Inherit |
| gsdt-project-researcher | Opus | Sonnet | Haiku | Inherit |
| gsdt-research-synthesizer | Sonnet | Sonnet | Haiku | Inherit |
| gsdt-debugger | Opus | Sonnet | Sonnet | Inherit |
| gsdt-codebase-mapper | Sonnet | Haiku | Haiku | Inherit |
| gsdt-verifier | Sonnet | Sonnet | Haiku | Inherit |
| gsdt-plan-checker | Sonnet | Sonnet | Haiku | Inherit |
| gsdt-integration-checker | Sonnet | Sonnet | Haiku | Inherit |

**Profile philosophy:**
- **quality** -- Opus for all decision-making agents, Sonnet for read-only verification. Use when quota is available and the work is critical.
- **balanced** -- Opus only for planning (where architecture decisions happen), Sonnet for everything else. The default for good reason.
- **budget** -- Sonnet for anything that writes code, Haiku for research and verification. Use for high-volume work or less critical phases.
- **inherit** -- All agents use the current session model. Best when switching models dynamically (e.g. OpenCode `/model`), or when using Claude Code with non-Anthropic providers (OpenRouter, local models) to avoid unexpected API costs. For non-Claude runtimes (Codex, OpenCode, Gemini CLI), the installer sets `resolve_model_ids: "omit"` automatically -- see [Non-Claude Runtimes](#using-non-claude-runtimes-codex-opencode-gemini-cli).

## Usage Examples

### New Project (Full Cycle)

```bash
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
/gsdt:new-project            # Answer questions, configure, approve roadmap
/clear
/gsdt:discuss-phase 1        # Lock in your preferences
/gsdt:ui-phase 1             # Design contract (frontend phases)
/gsdt:plan-phase 1           # Research + plan + verify
/gsdt:execute-phase 1        # Parallel execution
/gsdt:verify-work 1          # Manual UAT
/gsdt:ship 1                 # Create PR from verified work
/gsdt:ui-review 1            # Visual audit (frontend phases)
/clear
/gsdt:next                   # Auto-detect and run next step
...
/gsdt:audit-milestone        # Check everything shipped
/gsdt:complete-milestone     # Archive, tag, done
/gsdt:session-report         # Generate session summary
```

### New Project from Existing Document

```bash
/gsdt:new-project --auto @prd.md   # Auto-runs research/requirements/roadmap from your doc
/clear
/gsdt:discuss-phase 1               # Normal flow from here
```

### Existing Codebase

```bash
/gsdt:map-codebase           # Analyze what exists (parallel agents)
/gsdt:new-project            # Questions focus on what you're ADDING
# (normal phase workflow from here)
```

### Quick Bug Fix

```bash
/gsdt:quick
> "Fix the login button not responding on mobile Safari"
```

### Resuming After a Break

```bash
/gsdt:progress               # See where you left off and what's next
# or
/gsdt:resume-work            # Full context restoration from last session
```

### Preparing for Release

```bash
/gsdt:audit-milestone        # Check requirements coverage, detect stubs
/gsdt:plan-milestone-gaps    # If audit found gaps, create phases to close them
/gsdt:complete-milestone     # Archive, tag, done
```

### Speed vs Quality Presets

| Scenario | Mode | Granularity | Profile | Research | Plan Check | Verifier |
|----------|------|-------|---------|----------|------------|----------|
| Prototyping | `yolo` | `coarse` | `budget` | off | off | off |
| Normal dev | `interactive` | `standard` | `balanced` | on | on | on |
| Production | `interactive` | `fine` | `quality` | on | on | on |

**Skipping discuss-phase in autonomous mode:** When running in `yolo` mode with well-established preferences already captured in PROJECT.md, set `workflow.skip_discuss: true` via `/gsdt:settings`. This bypasses the discuss-phase entirely and writes a minimal CONTEXT.md derived from the ROADMAP phase goal. Useful when your PROJECT.md and conventions are comprehensive enough that discussion adds no new information.

### Mid-Milestone Scope Changes

```bash
/gsdt:add-phase              # Append a new phase to the roadmap
# or
/gsdt:insert-phase 3         # Insert urgent work between phases 3 and 4
# or
/gsdt:remove-phase 7         # Descope phase 7 and renumber
```

### Multi-Project Workspaces

Work on multiple repos or features in parallel with isolated GSD state.

```bash
# Create a workspace with repos from your monorepo
/gsdt:new-workspace --name feature-b --repos hr-ui,ZeymoAPI

# Feature branch isolation — worktree of current repo with its own .claude/.gsdt-planning/
/gsdt:new-workspace --name feature-b --repos .

# Then cd into the workspace and initialize GSD
cd ~/gsdt-workspaces/feature-b
/gsdt:new-project

# List and manage workspaces
/gsdt:list-workspaces
/gsdt:remove-workspace feature-b
```

Each workspace gets:
- Its own `.claude/.gsdt-planning/` directory (fully independent from source repos)
- Git worktrees (default) or clones of specified repos
- A `WORKSPACE.md` manifest tracking member repos

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Project already initialized"

You ran `/gsdt:new-project` but `.claude/.gsdt-planning/PROJECT.md` already exists. This is a safety check. If you want to start over, delete the `.claude/.gsdt-planning/` directory first.

### Context Degradation During Long Sessions

Clear your context window between major commands: `/clear` in Claude Code. GSD is designed around fresh contexts -- every subagent gets a clean 200K window. If quality is dropping in the main session, clear and use `/gsdt:resume-work` or `/gsdt:progress` to restore state.

### Plans Seem Wrong or Misaligned

Run `/gsdt:discuss-phase [N]` before planning. Most plan quality issues come from Claude making assumptions that `CONTEXT.md` would have prevented. You can also run `/gsdt:list-phase-assumptions [N]` to see what Claude intends to do before committing to a plan.

### Execution Fails or Produces Stubs

Check that the plan was not too ambitious. Plans should have 2-3 tasks maximum. If tasks are too large, they exceed what a single context window can produce reliably. Re-plan with smaller scope.

### Lost Track of Where You Are

Run `/gsdt:progress`. It reads all state files and tells you exactly where you are and what to do next.

### Need to Change Something After Execution

Do not re-run `/gsdt:execute-phase`. Use `/gsdt:quick` for targeted fixes, or `/gsdt:verify-work` to systematically identify and fix issues through UAT.

### Model Costs Too High

Switch to budget profile: `/gsdt:set-profile budget`. Disable research and plan-check agents via `/gsdt:settings` if the domain is familiar to you (or to Claude).

### Using Non-Claude Runtimes (Codex, OpenCode, Gemini CLI)

If you installed GSD for a non-Claude runtime, the installer already configured model resolution so all agents use the runtime's default model. No manual setup is needed. Specifically, the installer sets `resolve_model_ids: "omit"` in your config, which tells GSD to skip Anthropic model ID resolution and let the runtime choose its own default model.

To assign different models to different agents on a non-Claude runtime, add `model_overrides` to `.claude/.gsdt-planning/config.json` with fully-qualified model IDs that your runtime recognizes:

```json
{
  "resolve_model_ids": "omit",
  "model_overrides": {
    "gsdt-planner": "o3",
    "gsdt-executor": "o4-mini",
    "gsdt-debugger": "o3"
  }
}
```

The installer auto-configures `resolve_model_ids: "omit"` for Gemini CLI, OpenCode, and Codex. If you're manually setting up a non-Claude runtime, add it to `.claude/.gsdt-planning/config.json` yourself.

See the [Configuration Reference](CONFIGURATION.md#non-claude-runtimes-codex-opencode-gemini-cli) for the full explanation.

### Using Claude Code with Non-Anthropic Providers (OpenRouter, Local)

If GSD subagents call Anthropic models and you're paying through OpenRouter or a local provider, switch to the `inherit` profile: `/gsdt:set-profile inherit`. This makes all agents use your current session model instead of specific Anthropic models. See also `/gsdt:settings` → Model Profile → Inherit.

### Working on a Sensitive/Private Project

Set `commit_docs: false` during `/gsdt:new-project` or via `/gsdt:settings`. Add `.claude/.gsdt-planning/` to your `.gitignore`. Planning artifacts stay local and never touch git.

### GSD Update Overwrote My Local Changes

Since v1.17, the installer backs up locally modified files to `gsdt-local-patches/`. Run `/gsdt:reapply-patches` to merge your changes back.

### Workflow Diagnostics (`/gsdt:forensics`)

When a workflow fails in a way that isn't obvious -- plans reference nonexistent files, execution produces unexpected results, or state seems corrupted -- run `/gsdt:forensics` to generate a diagnostic report.

**What it checks:**
- Git history anomalies (orphaned commits, unexpected branch state, rebase artifacts)
- Artifact integrity (missing or malformed planning files, broken cross-references)
- State inconsistencies (ROADMAP status vs. actual file presence, config drift)

**Output:** A diagnostic report written to `.claude/.gsdt-planning/forensics/` with findings and suggested remediation steps.

### Subagent Appears to Fail but Work Was Done

A known workaround exists for a Claude Code classification bug. GSD's orchestrators (execute-phase, quick) spot-check actual output before reporting failure. If you see a failure message but commits were made, check `git log` -- the work may have succeeded.

### Parallel Execution Causes Build Lock Errors

If you see pre-commit hook failures, cargo lock contention, or 30+ minute execution times during parallel wave execution, this is caused by multiple agents triggering build tools simultaneously. GSD handles this automatically since v1.26 — parallel agents use `--no-verify` on commits and the orchestrator runs hooks once after each wave. If you're on an older version, add this to your project's `CLAUDE.md`:

```markdown
## Git Commit Rules for Agents
All subagent/executor commits MUST use `--no-verify`.
```

To disable parallel execution entirely: `/gsdt:settings` → set `parallelization.enabled` to `false`.

### Windows: Installation Crashes on Protected Directories

If the installer crashes with `EPERM: operation not permitted, scandir` on Windows, this is caused by OS-protected directories (e.g., Chromium browser profiles). Fixed since v1.24 — update to the latest version. As a workaround, temporarily rename the problematic directory before running the installer.
